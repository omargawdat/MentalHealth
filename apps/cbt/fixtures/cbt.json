      "name": "All-or-Nothing Thinking",
      "explanation": "This cognitive distortion involves seeing situations in black-and-white terms. For instance, if your performance falls short of perfect, you view yourself as a complete failure. This thinking pattern often leads to extreme reactions and stress.",
      "tips": "Identify areas where you use terms like 'always' or 'never'. Practice acknowledging the gray areas. For example, if you make a mistake at work, instead of thinking 'I always mess up', consider 'I did well on this project, but there's room for improvement'."

      "name": "Overgeneralization",
      "explanation": "Overgeneralization occurs when you perceive a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat. For example, after failing a test, you might think, 'I’m always bad at tests, I’ll never succeed in school.'",
      "tips": "Challenge overgeneralized thoughts by looking at evidence. Ask yourself, 'Is it really true that this one event defines all my future experiences?' Write down counterexamples where you have succeeded."

      "name": "Mental Filter",
      "explanation": "This involves focusing solely on the negative aspects of a situation, filtering out all positive aspects. For instance, receiving praise on a project but dwelling on a minor criticism.",
      "tips": "Practice balanced thinking by acknowledging both positive and negative aspects. Keep a journal to note positive experiences daily. This helps create a more balanced view of situations."

      "name": "Disqualifying the Positive",
      "explanation": "You dismiss positive experiences by insisting they 'don’t count'. For example, you may believe that your success is due to luck, rather than your skills and effort.",
      "tips": "When you catch yourself disqualifying the positive, take a moment to reframe your thoughts. Acknowledge your role in your successes. Keep a success log to remind yourself of your achievements."

      "name": "Jumping to Conclusions",
      "explanation": "This involves making negative interpretations without concrete evidence. This can take two forms: mind reading (assuming others think negatively of you) and fortune telling (predicting a negative outcome).",
      "tips": "Ask yourself, 'What evidence do I have for this thought?' Practice gathering facts before jumping to conclusions. Engage in open communication to clarify misunderstandings."

      "name": "Magnification or Minimization",
      "explanation": "Magnification involves exaggerating the importance of problems or flaws, while minimization involves downplaying your strengths and achievements.",
      "tips": "Aim for a balanced perspective. When facing a problem, consider its actual impact. When reflecting on achievements, acknowledge your hard work and effort objectively."

      "name": "Emotional Reasoning",
      "explanation": "This involves assuming that your negative emotions reflect the reality of a situation. For example, feeling anxious about a presentation might lead you to believe it's going to be a disaster.",
      "tips": "Separate feelings from facts. When you feel a certain way, ask yourself, 'What evidence do I have that supports this feeling?' Practice grounding techniques to stay present and factual."

      "name": "Should Statements",
      "explanation": "Using 'should' statements can create unrealistic expectations and lead to feelings of guilt or frustration. For example, 'I should always be successful at everything I do.'",
      "tips": "Replace 'should' with 'could' or 'it would be nice if'. This shift helps set realistic goals and reduces self-imposed pressure. Recognize and accept your limitations as a part of being human."

      "explanation": "This involves assigning a label to yourself or others based on one instance. For example, calling yourself 'a failure' after making a mistake.",
      "tips": "Focus on specific behaviors instead of labels. For example, instead of saying 'I’m a failure', say 'I made a mistake this time, but I can learn from it and do better next time'."
